# Word-Guess-Game
an imitation hangman game!

It works like the well known, paper based hangman game: the player must to figure out a word (I WILL PICK A THEME / PROBALY SEINFELD CHARACTERS AND QUOTES).
All the word's letters replaced with underscores (except spaces).
The player has a given number of possibility to find the word's letters.
If he correctly chosen a letter (the word contains it), the letter will apper in the word, if not, he lose one chance.
If he figures out the word, before he runs out of possibilities, he win.

When the game starts, it show a picture from a SEINFELD.
After a wrong choice, it start to draw a person on it.
Every wrong answer draws a part of the person.
When the picture complete(player run out of possibilities),
the hanged SEINFELD man completely appers, the user lose.
